## Review

I personally can't recommend this app. I think the overall UI while being very clean makes it a bit challenging to access particular things.

I think what makes me sad about this app was that there was clearly great intention to start.  
They include a section for organizations to post prayer requests. I think this could be great if you have your local congregation's leadership posting their current prayer requests (like a new ministry starting, or guidance for next steps in an important decision, etc). Additionally, there were larger organizations like bible translators who had organizations publicly available as well. The problem I found was that these organizations hadn't posted any updates for years. Additionally, a lot of them posted 6-7 prayers, which meant when I went to pray, I spent half of my prayer time going through just this organization.

This was a similar story for the premade prayers. They were very short, often just a phrase or two. And it just felt like it didn't provide a depth that I would get in a prayer from the Book of Common Prayer for example. Do I want all of the prayers to be in that form? No, but some would have been nice.

Additionally, you can set reminders (which are useful and personally something I value in a prayer app), BUT when you pray through your entire list of prayers, it doesn't mark them as prayed in your list of notifications. This meant daily I would receive a notification (and the little red dot in the upper corner of the app) to pray. Then I would open the app, go through all of my prayers for the day, and the little dot would still be there. I would have to go to notifications, open that specific prayer, and then pray just that prayer so that the notification would go away. This is extremely petty/small. But any friction in a prayer app takes the focus away from God and onto the device. 

I think if you get use to the UI, and you get a group that all agrees that it works well enough, then go for it. But I'm not going to recommend it unless other apps don't offer something this app does.
