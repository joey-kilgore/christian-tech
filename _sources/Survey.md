# Survey
This is the aggregation of a google form survey. Results are updated on a regular basis (though not instantly). The google form is also set to allow for going back and updating your responses as your tech usage changes. I pray this is a way for us to understand more of how the Church body as a whole interacts with technology.

Please share the google form to all Christians you think may be interested, regardless of their tech savviness.
