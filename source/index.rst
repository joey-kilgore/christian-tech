Welcome to christian-tech
==========================================

This website is designed as an aggregation of all the wonderful and rich tools
that have been made to enrich Christian's walk with Christ with technology.

If you have suggestions for more apps that I have missed, or you would like to
contribute to this project, please checkout the `github page <https://github.com/joey-kilgore/christian-tech>`_

Addtiionally, to give the body an understanding of how we use technology as a whole,
incorporated in this website is the aggregation of data from a google survey.
I hope that this gives us a chance to understand how our brothers and sisters in Christ
use technology (and maybe find more ways for us to enrich our walk). 
Please fill out and share the google survey with any Christians (regardless of their
technical comprehension)
